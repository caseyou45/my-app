# NewsCycle Frontend
This is the React fronted to a fullstack website called NewsCycle. The backend, made with Springboot, is also available to view as one of my repos. The basic premise is that this website is a place to read and share comments about the news. This website pulls the day's news with NewsAPI. Users can create permanent accounts or timed burner accounts that cannot be logged back into after 24 hours. Authorization is handled with JSON Web Tokens and bcrypt. Features include threaded comments and the ability to like articles and comments. The databse runs on MySQL.

I first created the backend for this website using Node.js as the backend. When learning Java, I decided to migrate the backend to Springboot and refactor the frontend as well.

Both systems use JWT for authorization. I found the Springboot implementation much easier to manage once I got everything in place. As this was my first foray into a Java-based web service, the learning curve was at times steep, but eventually manageable.



## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
